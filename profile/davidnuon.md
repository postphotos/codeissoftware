During the day, David Nuon writes web apps and manages servers. At night? He writes Rust and Python to teach computers how to see. David enjoys retro-computing and esoteric programming languages. If it’s old or no one has heard of it, he’s probably going to be in to it.

Is he the hero Long Beach deserves, but no one needs? Probably. 

He owns a pet [glider](http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Glider) named Steve. 

Here's where you can find him.
