Nicholas Hrboka is a full stack developer specializing in web applications. Currently working freelance, he has worked on content management systems with React, static websites, and web applications. Current projects include a few startup gigs, like optimizing an MVP for investors, barjoker.com, an online shopping site, and a few static websites for local business. He enjoys programming challenges in JavaScript and C++, and is always learning from bugs, stack overflow, articles, e-books, and local meetups. 

Nick quit his career in business loans to pursue an interest in programming and never looked back. As a musician, he has always had a passion for creation. During the day he can be found working in random locations, attending classes, creating virtually anything he can imagine, and running around the cliffs of Palos Verdes. At night, he can be found performing live music and attending various tech events.
